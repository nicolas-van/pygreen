# PyGreen

A micro web framework/static web site generator.

PyGreen is a simple tool to generate small web sites. The concept is to put all files to serve in a folder and invoke
the [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) template engine on all .html files. The result is quite similar to a classic
PHP application, but with the good features of the Mako templates (like inheritance) and the cool syntax of Python.

PyGreen uses the MIT license.

## Quick Start

To install:

    sudo easy_install pygreen

To launch and serve files:

    pygreen serve

The above command will serve the files located in the current folder. All files with the .html extension will also be
processed by Mako. So if the current folder contains a file index.html with the following code:

    <p>Hello, my age is ${30 - 2}.</p>

When going to http://localhost:8080, you will see:

    <p>Hello, my age is 28.</p>

PyGreen can also export all the files of you current folder after having the .html files processed by Mako. To do so,
type this command:

    pygreen gen <output_folder>

This can be useful to post your files on Github Pages or any other free static files hosting services.

## Features

PyGreen was designed to *not* have a lot of features. Mako templates can contain Python code, so you can always code
anything you need. The following features are still useful in most projects and are directly integrated in PyGreen.

### Non-generated files

All files with the .mako or .py extension will not be outputed by pygreen gen. This is useful to avoid generating macros
files or templates to inherit. Hidden files (files beginning with '.') will not be generated either.

### Markdown

While it is easy to define your own macro for markdown, it's still a recurrent need for most sites. So there is a
default Mako filter for that:

    <%block filter="markdown">
    Look at my title
    ================
    </%block>


## FAQ

### I miss feature XYZ, can you add it?

No. But you can. Easily. PyGreen can be a command line application or it can be a small framework to ease creation of
complete Python web applications. PyGreen is just [Mako](http://www.makotemplates.org/) templates served using the
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web framework ([Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/) in version 1.x). You can easily modify
any of these using some python code. Example:

    from pygreen import pygreen

    pygreen.app # the Flask wsgi application, use the @route() decorator to add new routes
    pygreen.templates # the Mako TemplateLookup object, do what you want with it

    pygreen.cli() # call the command line interface of PyGreen, you can use it or
    # just launch a web server using the Flask application object

It's important to understand that PyGreen is just a helper that allows to make simple things simple (like defining 3
html files that inherit from a common template without the need to type code) but doesn't restrict you. You need
anything complex? Mako templates can contain Python code so import whatever you need and use the features it provides.
If you need anything more complex hack through PyGreen and do it. Read the PyGreen code, it's 100 lines with some
documentation, anyone can understand it. If you read this you should be a Python programmer, so just type the code and
get the job done.

### Why is it so cool?

PyGreen was primarily created to be a static web site generator more effective than existing ones. The problem of
existing site generators like Jekyll or Hyde is that they have a fixed number of features. Even if their creators try to
add advanced features those will not be correctly documented, so the users do not know how to use them.

The fact that PyGreen has a small set of features **is a feature**. You don't need to spend hours to read crappy
documentation before discovering it's impossible to do what you want. If you need to do anything which is not trivial
you know you will have to code it, so just do it. That's what I call being pragmatic.

### Does PyGreen need contributions?

Yes! Report issues, write examples in the wiki, propose improvements,
[everything is on Github](https://github.com/nicolas-van/pygreen). Just keep in mind that PyGreen is designed to be
minimalist, so big features will probably not be accepted.

You can also write articles or blog posts about PyGreen.
